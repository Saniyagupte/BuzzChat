# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Socket.IO**. It allows users to join chat rooms, send messages, and see other participants in the room.
I developed this application while learning about **sockets** and real-time communication.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using WebSockets.
- Join specific chat rooms.
- Display active users in the chat room.
- Simple and clean user interface.
- Ability to leave the chat room.
